\newpage
For some problems, the large step-size does not work. Firstly, if we examine
the eigenvalues of the hessian we see negative values (in the latter two
functions), which implies that these latter functions are not convex. Secondly,
a larger step-size corresponds with a higher Lipschitz constant (i.e. one needs
the step size to be bounded by $\frac{1}{L}$, where $L$ is the Lipschitz
coefficient), which might break whatever Lipschitz continuity assumption we are
making. Note that two sufficient conditions for the step sizes $\epsilon_t$ are
that
\begin{align}
    \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \epsilon_t  &= \infty \\
    \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \epsilon_t^{2} &< \infty
\end{align}
